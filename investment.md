## Investing 101: Stock Market Course for Beginners

- The best source for *stock picks* is the Motley Fool.  The Motley Fool was founded on the principle of helping the average investor invest smarter.  Their popular stock newsletter, the Stock Advisor, has outperformed the market by over 300% since inception

- The benefit of a *savings account* is that you can make deposits and withdrawals whenever you want, no questions asked. Plus, your deposit is protected. Savings accounts are all basically the same, but you need to pay close attention to the fine print. The typical differentiators are:
    - Interest rate
    - Frequency of interest (earnings) posting periods
    - Different minimum balance accounts that pay higher interest rates if you maintain the minimum amount on a deposit
    - Fees for withdrawals, statements, etc.

- *Certificates of Deposit (CDs)* you agree to deposit a specific amount of money for a fixed period of time (aka maturity). In return, your financial institution agrees to pay you interest (usually higher than regular savings accounts) over this period. Your bank will offer you many different maturities or terms for CDâ€™s: 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, etc. Generally you will find that the longer the term of the CD, the greater the interest rate you earn. When you buy a CD you are locked into that interest rate for the life of the CD. If you take out your money before the full term, the bank will charge you a penalty.
