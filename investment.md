## Investing 101: Stock Market Course for Beginners

- The best source for **stock picks** is the Motley Fool.  The Motley Fool was founded on the principle of helping the average investor invest smarter.  Their popular stock newsletter, the Stock Advisor, has outperformed the market by over 300% since inception

- The benefit of a **savings account** is that you can make deposits and withdrawals whenever you want, no questions asked. Plus, your deposit is protected. Savings accounts are all basically the same, but you need to pay close attention to the fine print. The typical differentiators are:
    - Interest rate
    - Frequency of interest (earnings) posting periods
    - Different minimum balance accounts that pay higher interest rates if you maintain the minimum amount on a deposit
    - Fees for withdrawals, statements, etc.

- **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)** you agree to deposit a specific amount of money for a fixed period of time (aka maturity). In return, your financial institution agrees to pay you interest (usually higher than regular savings accounts) over this period. Your bank will offer you many different maturities or terms for CD’s: 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, etc. Generally you will find that the longer the term of the CD, the greater the interest rate you earn. When you buy a CD you are locked into that interest rate for the life of the CD. If you take out your money before the full term, the bank will charge you a penalty.

- **Money Market Accounts (MMAs)**. These accounts are designed to be a combination of the features of a classic savings account and a CD. Some typical features include:
    - Higher interest rate than classic savings accounts
    - No maturity date as with a CD
    - A minimum balance that must be maintained (e.g., $2,500)
    - Limited withdrawals each month (typically up to six transactions per month)

- **Stocks** are "equity investments" which means that when you own shares of a company you own part of that company. For example, if you own 1,000 shares of Apple Computer stock and Apple has 1,000,000 shares that are "issued and outstanding," then you own 0.1% of the company. If Apple were then to be sold to another company for $50,000,000, then each share would be worth $50 ($50 million divided by 1 million shares). At $50 a share, you would receive $50,000 for your 1,000 shares. Therefore, the price of a stock is simply the market’s determination of the company’s value. That value is dependent on its assets, its current profits, and its expected future profits.

- **The market’s determination of the company’s value**... By "market" we mean the tens of thousands of people around the world that are following a stock at any given time (analysts on Wall Street, brokers around the world at every brokerage firm, and individual investors). The stock market is a perfect example of supply and demand determining the price of something. The price changes every day, and for most popular stocks, nearly every second, based on the supply and demand provided by the thousands of buyers and sellers that are now connected electronically.

- **Stock exchange**, the place where you can buy or sell shares of stock.  In the U.S. there are three major exchanges: the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which are located on Wall Street in lower Manhattan in New York City.

- **Key Role** of stock exchanges. When a company raises money in a stock offering it sells shares directly to the initial investors. But when those investors no longer want to hold shares, the exchanges provide a place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares.

- **Making Money with Stocks**:
    1. rise in price of a stock
    2. dividends that companies pay out to their shareholders

> **_NOTE:_**  Dividends are a wonderful thing and a few high dividend paying stocks should be part of your overall portfolio. General Electric (GE) is currently paying out $0.75 year and the stock is at $16.00 so it is paying out a 4.6875% dividend yield. That’s a great return when banks are paying out less than 1%.

- A **Mutual Funds** is a type of investment where a money manager takes your cash and invests it as he sees fit, usually following some rough guidelines. You simply find a fund that matches your objective, you review its past performance and its management team, and then you write a check to that mutual fund.

- Most mutual funds are called **"Open-Ended" funds** because they will continue to take your cash, manage it for you, and issue shares to show your ownership. Each night the mutual funds calculate the value of all of their holdings and divided that value by the number of shares they have issued, and that number is called the **Net Asset Value or NAV**. So if the Fidelity Bank Fund had a value of $10.00 and you write them a check for $5,000 you would now own 500 shares of this fund. Gains, losses, and earnings are mutually shared with investors in proportion to the size of their investment.

- To research mutual funds, **Morningstar.com** is one of the top web sites to check out. The Morningstar website:
    - rates funds on a 1-5 scale so you can quickly review a fund’s performance
    - shows mutual fund performance against relevant sectors and other funds
    - shows the top holdings (what stocks they own) in all mutual funds
    - shows the people who manage these funds
    - shows the expense fees for each fund

> **_NOTE:_**  Management fees are one of the key metrics to watch out for as an investor because they can quickly and devilishly eat into your profits over time. Stocks are way better

- **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)** are a cross between mutual funds and stocks. ETFs are simply a portfolio of stocks or bonds or other investments that trade on a stock exchange just like a regular stock does. ETFs have the benefits of Mutual Funds in that one investment allows ownership in a group of Stocks, and usually that ownership is targeted to a specific industry, region or market segment. Unlike Mutual Funds, the ETF prices change throughout the day as they are bought and sold based on the performance of the stocks that the ETF is holding

- **ETFs Leverage**... Some ETFs are also leveraged, which means that they have a multiple of 2x or 3x the performance of their underlying industry. This ability to react quickly makes them a favorite of day traders and other active investors because they are usually quite volatile. The leveraged ETFs are extremely popular with traders. With the leveraged ETFs, when the sector gains 1 percent, the ETF can gain 2 or even 3 percent

- **ETFs tied to Index**, some ETFs are tied to an index, which make them “exchange-traded index funds”. For example: 
    - SPY ETF tries to mirror the composition of the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500
    - GLD ETF follows the market price of gold
    - DIA ETF tries to mirror the composition of the Dow Jones

- Unlike stocks, which are equity instruments, **bonds** are **debt instruments**. Bonds are not nearly as liquid as stocks and ETFs, and therefore there is not nearly as much information publicly and freely available. If you are going to buy bonds, always buy them from a reputable source and always check your prices to make sure you are getting a fair price.

- **Gold and Other Precious Metals**, there are five options on how you can invest in precious metals:
    1. Coins and bars
    2. Certificates, it indicate your ownership in specified amounts of precious metals
    3. Precious metal mutual funds
    4. Precious metal ETFs
    5. Purchase precious metal futures (most speculative and risky option if it is not for hedging purposes)

Investing prudently in precious metals is much more complicated since it is a global commodity, an inflation hedge, an interest rate hedge, and a the-world-is-ending-soon hedge.
