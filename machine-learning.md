# Machine Learning

Machine Learning algorithm can be divided into 4 categories. Knowing the type of ML problem you want to solve is often the hardest part. Each category has a certain types of estimators:

1. Regression Algorithms

2. Pattern Recognition Algorithms

3. Cluster Algorithms

4. Decision Matrix Algorithms
